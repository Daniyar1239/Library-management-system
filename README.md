# Library-management-system
Library management system implemented in C++

This is the second-year project in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Nazarbayev University.

The library contains 127 different books. 


The program proposes the options of (1) Adding/deleting/modifying a book, (2) searching for a book, (3) sorting books, (4) issuing/returning a book, (5) printing all the books in the library.

Please, read the attached the final report, which describes the coding approach and some important OOP concepts implemented in the program.

The repository contains the screenshot of a simple and user-friendly program interface. It can be improved, if needed. 

Good luck!
